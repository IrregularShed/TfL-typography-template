                            The carrier, more especially the male bird, is
                            also remarkable from the wonderful development of
                            the carunculated skin about the head, and this is
                            accompanied by greatly elongated eyelids, very large
                            external orifices to the nostrils, and a wide gape of mouth.

                            almost like that of a finch; and the common tumbler
                            has the singular inherited habit of flying at a great
                            height in a compact flock, and tumbling in the air head
                            over heels. The runt is a bird of great size, with long,
                            massive beak and large feet; some of the sub-breeds of
                            runts have very long necks, others very long wings and
                            tails, others singularly short tails. The barb is allied
                            to the carrier, but, instead of a long beak, has a very
                            short and broad one.

                        Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from
                        the Sun in the Solar System. It is the fourth-largest
                        planet by diameter and the third-largest by mass.
                        Among the gaseous planets in the Solar System, Neptune
                        is the most dense. Neptune is 17 times the mass of
                        Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin
                        Uranus, which is 15 times the mass of Earth, and not as
                        dense as Neptune. Neptune orbits the Sun at an average
                        distance of 30.1 astronomical units. Named after the
                        Roman god of the sea, its astronomical symbol is ♆, a
                        stylised version of the god Neptune's trident.

                    <p>
                        Neptune is similar in composition to Uranus, and both
                        have compositions that differ from those of the larger
                        gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn. Neptune's atmosphere,
                        like Jupiter's and Saturn's, is composed primarily of
                        hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons
                        and possibly nitrogen; it contains a higher proportion
                        of "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane. Astronomers
                        sometimes categorise Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants"
                        to emphasise this distinction. The interior of Neptune,
                        like that of Uranus, is primarily composed of ices and
                        rock. Perhaps the core has a solid surface, but the
                        temperature would be thousands of degrees and the
                        atmospheric pressure crushing. Traces of methane in the
                        outermost regions in part account for the planet's blue
                        appearance.

                        Neptune was the first planet found by mathematical
                        prediction rather than by empirical observation.
                        Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis
                        Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational
                        perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently
                        observed on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within
                        a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier,
                        and its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly
                        thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 13 moons
                        were located telescopically until the 20th century. Neptune
                        was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on
                        25 August 1989.

                        In contrast to the hazy, relatively featureless atmosphere
                        of Uranus, Neptune's atmosphere has active and visible weather
                        patterns. For example, at the time of the 1989 Voyager 2
                        flyby, the planet's southern hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot
                        comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. These weather patterns
                        are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the
                        Solar System, with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100
                        kilometres per hour (1,300 mph). Because of its great distance
                        from the Sun, Neptune's outer atmosphere is one of the coldest
                        places in the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud
                        tops approaching 55 K (−218 °C). Temperatures at the planet's
                        centre are approximately 5,400 K (5,100 °C). Neptune has a
                        faint and fragmented ring system (labelled "arcs"), which may
                        have been detected during the 1960s but was indisputably
                        confirmed only in 1989 by Voyager 2.

                        From its discovery in 1846 until the subsequent discovery of
                        Pluto in 1930, Neptune was the farthest known planet. Upon Pluto's
                        discovery Neptune became the penultimate planet, save for a 20-year
                        period between 1979 and 1999 when Pluto's elliptical orbit
                        brought it closer to the Sun than Neptune.[38] The discovery of
                        the Kuiper belt in 1992 led many astronomers to debate whether
                        Pluto should be considered a planet in its own right or part of the
                        belt's larger structure.[39][40] In 2006, the International Astronomical
                        Union defined the word "planet" for the first time, reclassifying Pluto
                        as a "dwarf planet" and making Neptune once again the last planet in
                        the Solar System. (Source)
