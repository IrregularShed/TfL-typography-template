                            The carrier, more especially the male bird, is
                            also remarkable from the wonderful development of
                            the carunculated skin about the head, and this is
                            accompanied by greatly elongated eyelids, very large
                            external orifices to the nostrils, and a wide gape of mouth.

                            The short-faced tumbler has a beak in outline
                            almost like that of a finch; and the common tumbler
                            has the singular inherited habit of flying at a great
                            height in a compact flock, and tumbling in the air head
                            over heels. The runt is a bird of great size, with long,
                            massive beak and large feet; some of the sub-breeds of
                            runts have very long necks, others very long wings and
                            tails, others singularly short tails. The barb is allied
                            to the carrier, but, instead of a long beak, has a very
                            short and broad one.

                        Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from
                        the Sun in the Solar System. It is the fourth-largest
                        planet by diameter and the third-largest by mass.
                        Among the gaseous planets in the Solar System, Neptune
                        is the most dense. Neptune is 17 times the mass of
                        Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin
                        Uranus, which is 15 times the mass of Earth, and not as
                        dense as Neptune. Neptune orbits the Sun at an average
                        distance of 30.1 astronomical units. Named after the
                        Roman god of the sea, its astronomical symbol is ♆, a
                        stylised version of the god Neptune's trident.

                        Neptune is similar in composition to Uranus, and
                        both have compositions that differ from those of the
                        larger gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn.

                        Neptune was the first planet found by mathematical
                        prediction rather than by empirical observation.
                        Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis
                        Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational
                        perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently
                        observed on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within
                        a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier,
                        and its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly
                        thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 13 moons
                        were located telescopically until the 20th century. Neptune
                        was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on
                        25 August 1989.
