                        When registering you'll need to tell us:

                        Which vehicles you're registering for Auto Pay (£10 per vehicle per year)
                        Your credit or debit card details (excluding Maestro or Solo)
                        You must be over 18 to register. You can receive your statements online or by post and you can change your vehicle and payment details at any time online.

                        You need to register for a customer account first and then register for CC Auto Pay. Until you received confirmation that you have paid the £10 registration charge per vehicle, you have not completed the process for setting up CC Auto Pay.

                        Please remember that your Auto Pay may be suspended if we are unable to collect a payment. Please check your account regularly to make sure that your payment card hasn't expired and sufficient funds are available.
